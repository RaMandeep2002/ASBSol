# What is DeFi?

## Introduction

DeFi, short for Decentralized Finance, is a revolutionary concept that aims to transform traditional financial systems by leveraging blockchain technology. Unlike traditional finance, DeFi eliminates the need for intermediaries, such as banks or financial institutions, by building a decentralized ecosystem of financial applications on public blockchains like Ethereum.

## Key Features

- **Decentralization**: DeFi applications are powered by blockchain networks, ensuring no central authority controls the ecosystem. Transactions and operations are verified and recorded by a distributed network of nodes.

- **Openness**: DeFi protocols and smart contracts are open-source, allowing transparency, community inspection, and collaborative development. Anyone can review the code, contribute, and suggest improvements.

- **Interoperability**: DeFi encourages interoperability, enabling various applications to interact and share data seamlessly across different platforms. This creates a connected and efficient financial ecosystem.

- **Programmability**: Smart contracts enable programmable financial agreements and transactions. Users can automate complex financial operations and create new financial instruments, fostering innovation.

- **Accessibility**: DeFi services are accessible to anyone with an internet connection, without the need for a traditional bank account or credit check. This promotes financial inclusion and global accessibility.
